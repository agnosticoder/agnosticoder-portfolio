## First Interaction with coding

Seeing my brother doing coding always seemed to me like some kind of wizardry until I got myself enrolled in a Mechanical Engineering degree after twelfth grade. In my second term of undergrad, I had a subject called FCPIT (Fundamentals of Computer Programming and Information Technology) which was an introductory course on C programming. It took me a couple of lectures to get used to this new paradigm shift but after that, I was completely drawn into coding. I would read the textbook day and night to understand the core concepts like variables, constants, functions, operators, operands, precedence etc. I would borrow my roommate's laptop to solve some problems. I had fun learning to code even though I couldn’t think of single-use coding at that moment. Leaving a deep impression on me I couldn’t have a chance to code until years later after my GATE failure.

## Dreaming Big and Failing

My dreams were big in spite of graduating from the so-called third-tier college. I wanted to work for Fortune 500 oil companies and the only way for me to get into those is to compete against the best in the country.

I moved to Delhi, India to prepare for the GATE (Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering) exam. This is a test in which you get tested on your coursework of engineering degree which in my case was mechanical engineering. Top rankers get interview calls from these big oil companies. Historically speaking, less than 0.5% of all candidates get called for interviews. In the mechanical engineering field alone there were around 200,000 candidates. If you do the math, 0.5% of 200,000 is 1000. So I need to get in the top 1000 to get the interview call alone.

I prepared for one and half years for this exam and was able to score 1683 rank all over India. I was almost 700 candidates short of getting my dream job in a Fortune 500 oil company. I failed to achieve my goal which left me in the dilemma of spending one more year preparing for GATE again or doing something else.

## Coming back to coding again

There was one more thing that could satisfy my ‘achieve big’ stubbornness and that was coding. I only came to realize the potential of coding after reading this book which I randomly picked from the local streets of Delhi called “How to build a billion dollar app” by George Berkowski. This book helped me believe that it is possible to build something great using coding not worth millions but billions of dollars. Which seems like a childish dream now, sparked a never-ending love for coding in me.

Inspiration from this book led me to buy a Web Development course by Colt Steele on Udemy. I finished that course in three months and it taught me the basics of web development using HTML, CSS and Javascript. I also built some basic projects. I bought some more courses on CSS and Nodejs and completed those as well. I felt amazing learning code and finally getting to know the usefulness of coding in the real world.

## Moving to Canada for Postgrad (Backup Plan)

The more I learn, the less I felt I know and there is still a long way to go. It seemed like it was going to take a lot more learning before I can apply for an entry-level job. But I never second doubt myself. It was very clear in my mind that I never want to quit learning only because it's hard and could take some time to earn living from it. I was determined. I just needed a backup plan to survive while learning to code. 

I moved to Canada in July 2018 to pursue a postgrad in Supply Chain Management. It was a reasonable decision at that time that could help me earn while learning. I could work part-time while studying and most importantly Canada has better job prospects in the tech industry than India. It took me two years to complete my postgrad and get my degree in April 2020.

## Why not study Web Development

If you are wondering why wouldn’t I take admission in any Web Development-related course, the answer is I tried but no college in Canada would give me admission provided my undergrad in Mechanical Engineering. They only allow students from Computer Science or related field and guess what, Mechanical is not a related field in their opinion.

But that couldn’t stop me from achieving my goal. I would code whenever I get any chance in my busy schedule of doing my postgrad and working part-time. It wasn't perfect, I had some gaps when I didn’t code for many months in between. But eventually, I came back to learning code and I am glad I did. 

## Struggles with immigration

This part of my life was immigration. Although coding was and is the sole purpose of my life but sometimes you have something more important that you need to get done. After my studies, I urgently needed a job that could facilitate my immigration and help me get my Permanent Residency. I didn’t know how long its gonna take to get into the tech industry so I chose to do window cleaning (a little off, I know. I chose this because it paid well relative to other available jobs) as a way to get my permanent residency. I did window cleaning for two years and during that time I was promoted to the supervisor role. Eventually, it did help me get my permanent residency which was a huge weight off my chest. In simple words, it meant I could live permanently in Canada and can finally dedicate myself wholly to my goal which was and is getting my foot into the tech industry.

## Home Run

Now, this is the present and I quit my window cleaning job and devoted myself to full-time learning code. I saved some cash from my window cleaning job salary that would help me with my expenses during my learning. I am very hopeful that I would definitely be able to secure some entry-level position before I completely exhaust my savings. But even if I do exhaust my savings, I will start working part-time again along with learning.`.trim();
